*Addd refresh token
*Remove csrf_exempt where cookies are used
*Add caching for News API
*Move to DRF APIView / JWTAuthentication
*How does logout work in JWT authentication?
        JWT is stateless, so logout does not invalidate the token server-side.
        Logout works by removing the JWT from client storage (cookie or localStorage).
        For higher security, token blacklisting or short-lived access tokens with refresh tokens are used.

*Issue in add_user_preferences
        If one item fails, the entire request stops.
        Better:
        Validate all
        Insert valid ones
        Return partial success
